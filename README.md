# Line-Following-Robot

This repository contains the code used to create a line following robot. This was part of my 2nd year Embedded Systems Project at The University of Manchester. The objective was to create a fully autonomous line following robot from scratch (including the chassis and printed circuit board design). To achieve this objective, the robot used six infrared sensors in order to detect how much light was being reflected (the track was black and the line was white) and encoders to read the velocity of the robot. Although the original idea was to use a PID controller to adjust the velocity of each motor, this could not be finished due to the start of the covid-19 pandemic.
